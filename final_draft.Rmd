##### Introduction:  
-	Women have improved access to post-baccalaureate education  
-	However, there is much gender disparity in discipline-specific involvement and salaries  
-	In the US specifically, faculty salary has increased but female faculty consistently earn less than male faculty (cite table, https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_316.20.asp) 

##### Objectives:  
-	Assess trends in gender distribution in doctoral students in the US from 1985-2015  
-	Assess shifts in female enrollment in doctoral programs in Physical Sciences, Engineering, Education, and the Humanities and Arts in two ways:  
    - How female graduate student research interests have shifted between these four fields, and  
    - How the proportion of female graduate students in these fields have changed  
-	Compare male and female salaries after receiving a PhD  
-	Construct a model describing faculty salaries  

##### Conclusion:
-	Female involvement in higher education has improved, but there are still steps to be made for progress  
    - While the proportion of female doctoral recipients has increased, only 29% of researchers worldwide are women (cite UNESCO, https://www.tellmaps.com/uis/gender/?lang=en#!/tellmap/79054752)
    - Female candidates for jobs are assessed based on whether or not they have children, regardless of the legality of this assessment  
-  While the data we have are as much as we can gather, there are missing components that would be useful for parameterizing a model describing faculty salaries
    - Institution type: research institutions vs liberal arts colleges  
    - Race: women make less than men, but Black women, Asian women, and Hispanic women make less than white women (there are numbers, will find later)  
-	Race is a particularly egregious variable to be left out, especially since it stratifies so much of higher education  
    - 64% of Bachelorâ€™s degrees conferred are to white students (cite table, https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_322.20.asp)  
    -	66% of PhD recipients are white (cite table, https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_324.20.asp)  
    -	82% of professors are white (55% men, 27% women, cite figure, https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=61)
